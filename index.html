                <p>I am a <span>Responsive Developer</span> who thrives on the best user experience. When I'm not working, pursuing side projects or getting lost in the world of blogs and books, I can be found in the back yard with my fur-baby Curly.</p>

                <p>I was born in Jonquiere, Quebec, Canada and my parents moved me to East Hartford, Connecticut when I was just 12 days old. When I was 14 years old my parents moved back to Quebec but in Laval this time. I continued this back and forth across the border a few times and eventually landing in Kingston, Ontario, Canada.</p>

                <p>My passion: I LOVE coming up with new recipes! I enjoy coming up with different twists to old favorites as well as tring something for the first time. I am so happy when others try my creations and find they really like them.</p>

                <p>Fun fact: I was barely computer-literate when I started to learn coding. I'm sure I exasperated a few of my instructors with some of the questions I asked. After much confusion and hair pulling look at me now! Who would have guessed what I would be the "go-to person" for computer issues?</p>
